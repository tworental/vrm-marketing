    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to TwoRentals, a software-based and staff-powered property and
      vacation rental management service (the "Service").
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service is owned and operated by Dakicksoft OÜ, a Estonia
      corporation and its subsidiary (collectively, the "Company", "we", "us" and "our").
    </p>
    <p>
      We, at TwoRentals, respect your privacy. This privacy policy (the
      "Policy") outlines our privacy practices with respect to the Service,
      including the ways your personal information and data is collected,
      stored, used and shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Providing us with your personal information is a choice you make. We
      appreciate that and thank you for making this choice. You are not legally
      obligated to provide us with this information, but we do need it to allow
      you to use the Service.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Policy is combined into our Terms of Service (the "Terms"), and is a
      part of them. Please refer to our Terms of Service for more information
      about how the Service works. This privacy policy does not apply to data
      that is not personal data, including anonymous, de-identified, or
      aggregated data, even when such data has been derived from personal data.

      Guest personal information is shared with us for a business purpose only.
      We certify that this information:

    </ul>

    <h5>Aggregated information</h5>
    <p>
      We may use the information we collect, as outlined above, to compile
      anonymized or aggregated information. We may share, sell or otherwise
      communicate and make available such anonymized or aggregated information
      to any other third party, at our sole discretion. However, we will not
      knowingly or intentionally share information that can be reasonably used
      to reveal your identity without your consent.
    </p>

    <h5>Children’s Privacy</h5>

    <h5>Cookie Policy</h5>
    <p>
      This website uses cookies to recognize you when you visit our website.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer. They are
      designed to hold a small amount of data specific to a website or server
      that can be accessed either by the website or your computer. We use
      cookies to capture information described in the
      <a href="#what-and-why">What Data We Collect &amp; Why</a> section, such
      as IP address and electronic activity data.

    <h5>Transfer of data outside your territory</h5>
    <p>
      We may store and process information in various locations throughout the
      globe, including through cloud services. The laws in those other countries
      may provide a lesser degree of data protection than the laws of your own
      country. You agree to the transfer of your information to such other
      countries for the purpose of the processing as described in this Policy,
      including through cloud services.
    </p>

    <h5>Information Security</h5>
    <p>
      We implement measures to reduce the risks of damage, loss of information
      and unauthorized access or use of information. These measures do not

      you cannot expect that the Service will be immune to information security
      risks.

      for the purposes set forth above.

    <p>
      We may change this Policy. We will provide you notice of such changes

      of 30 days after you decline to accept the revised Policy.

    <h3>CCPA Notice</h3>
    <p>
      You may exercise certain consumer rights under the California Consumer
      Privacy Act (CCPA) by filling in this form. Your CCPA rights are described
      below.
    </p>

    <h4>Right to Know</h4>
    <p>
      You have the right to request information regarding the categories and
      specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, as
      well as the sources of that information, the business purpose for
      collecting it, and what types of third parties we share or sell it with.
      If you make a request more than twice in a 12-month period, you may be
      required to pay a small fee for this service.
    </p>

    <h4>Right to Deletion</h4>
    <p>
      You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal
      information. We will delete any personal information that is not critical
      to the normal business operation from our records and direct all of our
      service providers to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      We consider data to be critical to our business operation if they are used
      to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide goods or services to you</li>
      <li>Detect and resolve issues related to security or functionality</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Right to Non-Discrimination</h4>
    <p>If you exercise your consumer rights:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We will not deny goods or services to you</li>
      <li>
        We will not charge different prices or rates for goods or services,
        including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing
        penalties
      </li>
      <li>
        We will not provide a different level or quality of goods or services to
        you
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h4>
    <p>
      We do not sell any information that identifies you, such as your name or
      contact information. However, we do allow Ad Networks such as Facebook and
      Google to collect your electronic activity while on our website. Ad
      Networks may also collect IP address and information about your device and
      browser (such as the name and model number of your device) through cookies
      and similar tracking technologies on our website. They use this
      information to advertise to you after you leave our website. This is
      called "retargeted advertising." Under the CCPA’s broad definition of what
      it means to "sell" personal information, this form of advertising may be
      considered a "sale" of your information.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want us to provide this information to our advertisers, you
      may opt out here:
      <a href="https://optout.aboutads.info/">https://optout.aboutads.info/</a>.
    </p>

    <h4>Authorized Agent</h4>
    <p>
      You may designate someone as an authorized agent to make a request under
      CCPA on your behalf. You can do this by providing written permission to
      authorize an agent to act on your behalf; the agent will need to verify
      their identity with us. Agents authorized by power of attorney are exempt
      from having to provide written permission, but must show documentation
      that power of attorney has been granted. We will deny a request from an
      agent that does not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to
      act on your behalf.
    </p>

    <h4>Request Verification</h4>
    <p>
      Before we can respond to any CCPA requests, we will need to verify that
      you are who you say you are. Verification is important for preventing
      fraudulent requests and identity theft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The verification process depends on which type of request you make. For
      requests to access specific information or requests to delete information,
      we may require a higher level of verification. Typically, identity
      verification will require you to confirm certain information about
      yourself based on the information we have already collected. For example,
      we may ask you to reply from the email address we have on file for you
      that is associated with your name. If we cannot verify your identity, we
      cannot fulfill requests to exercise any rights accorded to you by CCPA.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some cases, we may have no reasonable method by which we can verify a
      consumer’s identity. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a consumer submits a request but we have not collected information
        about them, we cannot verify the request.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the only data we have collected about a consumer is gathered through
        website cookies (i.e., the consumer has visited our website and had no
        other interaction with us), we are unable to associate a requester with
        the data collected; therefore, we cannot verify the request.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>GDPR Notice</h3>
    <p>
      The following disclosure is made pursuant to the European General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR):
    </p>
    <p>
      As a data controller of our clients’ personal data, we are committed to
      protecting and respecting your privacy in compliance with EU- General Data
      Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016/679, dated April 27th 2016. This privacy
      statement explains when and why we collect personal information, how we
      use it, the conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we
      keep it secure. This Privacy Statement applies to the use of our products
      and to our sales, marketing and customer contract fulfillment activities.
      You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time; and to submit a
      complaint to the relevant supervisory data protection authority.
    </p>

    <h4>Our legal basis for collecting personal data</h4>
    <p>Collecting personal data based on consents:</p>
    <p>
      The collection of personal data based on consent from the data subject
      will be done by using "Consent Forms" that will store documentation
      related to the consent given by the individual. Individual consents will
      always be stored and documented in our systems.
    </p>

    <p>Collecting personal data based on contracts:</p>
    <p>
      We use personal information for fulfilling our obligations related to
      contracts and agreements with customers, partners and suppliers.
    </p>

    <p>Collecting personal data based on legitimate interest:</p>
    <p>
      We may use personal data if it is considered to be of legitimate interest,
      and if the privacy interests of the data subject do not override this
      interest. Normally, to establish the legal basis for data collection, an
      assessment has been made during which a mutual interest between TwoRentals
      and the individual person has been identified. This legal basis is
      primarily related to our sales and marketing purposes. We will always
      inform individuals about their privacy rights and the purpose for
      collecting personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please refer to the privacy policy to understand
      <a href="#what-and-why">What We Collect</a> along with our retention
      policy.
    </p>
